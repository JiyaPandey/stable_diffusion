# 🌌 Image Generation using Stable Diffusion & ComfyUI

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores AI-driven image generation using **Stable Diffusion** within **ComfyUI**. It focuses on creating visually striking and imaginative worlds based on carefully crafted prompts while using **negative prompts** to refine the outputs. The goal is to generate highly detailed, creative images that align closely with given descriptions.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Stable Diffusion** 🖼️ (AI-based image generation)
- **ComfyUI** 🔧 (Node-based workflow interface)
- **CLIP Text Encoder** ✍️ (Text-to-image conversion)
- **VAE Decode** 🎨 (Final image rendering)

## 🎯 Prompts Used
### 1️⃣ **The Floating Island of Bioluminescence**
**Prompt:** "A floating island in the sky, covered in glowing bioluminescent trees, with waterfalls cascading into the clouds below. A futuristic city hovers nearby, connected by glowing bridges."
**Negative Prompt:** No dark or dystopian themes, no grounded landscapes, no ruined buildings, no human activity.

### 2️⃣ **The Cybernetic Dragon**
**Prompt:** "A cybernetic dragon with neon-blue circuitry running through its scales, soaring above a futuristic metropolis filled with flying cars and holographic billboards."
**Negative Prompt:** No medieval or ancient elements, no organic wings, and only a cybernetic aesthetic.

### 3️⃣ **The Cosmic Sorcerer**
**Prompt:** "A mystical sorcerer in a robe made of swirling galaxies, holding a staff that emits cosmic energy, standing in an ancient temple with floating rune stones."
**Negative Prompt:** No traditional wizard hats, no medieval-style robes, no plain staff.
